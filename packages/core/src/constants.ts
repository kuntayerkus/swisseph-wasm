 *
 * This file only improves the **names**. The generated ones are mechanical
 * transforms of C macros (`Helctr`, `Nonut`, `MeanApog`) and make for a poor
 * public API. Both spellings work: the generated names are spread in, then
 * readable aliases are added alongside them.

/**
 * Celestial bodies.
 *
 * "Lilith" names three different things in astrology and they are constantly
 * confused. All three are here, under names that tell them apart:
 *
 *   `BlackMoonLilithMean` — the mean lunar apogee. **Not** a body. This is
 *                           what most astrology software calls "Lilith".
 *   `BlackMoonLilithTrue` — the osculating (true) apogee. A different answer.
 *   Asteroid 1181         — an actual asteroid: `AsteroidOffset + 1181`.
 *
 * The three give completely different positions.
 *
 * **Not every body in this enum behaves like a planet.** `Chiron`, `Pholus`,
 * `Ceres`, `Pallas`, `Juno` and `Vesta` need `seas_18.se1` and **throw** when
 * it is absent, where the planets fall back to Moshier. They sit next to
 * `Pluto` with nothing in the type to distinguish them, so a loop over "all
 * the bodies" works in Moshier mode until it reaches Chiron. Filter with
 * {@link REQUIRES_EPHEMERIS_FILE}.
