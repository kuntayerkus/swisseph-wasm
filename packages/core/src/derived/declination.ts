 * 84381.406 arcseconds, the IAU 2006 value — which is what Swiss Ephemeris

 * still widely quoted and differs by 0.042″; using it here would put this
 * constant permanently at odds with the library's own numbers.
 *
 * A convenience default only. Obliquity decreases by roughly 47 arcseconds
 * per century, so over the ±600-year span the data package covers it moves
 * about 0.08° — enough to flip a body sitting near the boundary from
 * in-bounds to out-of-bounds. Pass the true obliquity for the date when it
 * matters; `SwissEph#obliquity()` returns it.
